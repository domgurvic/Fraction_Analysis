# Fraction_Analysis by Dom Gurvic
University of Dundee, Computational Biology Division


Analising resulting pairs from MMPA by carrying out following:
  1. Detecting substructural matches of functional groups and moietes in LHS, RHS and calculating their difference
  2. Compiling list of only p-val based significant features in the fraction descriptors
  3. For each significant fraction calcualte change in other fractiosn and hence find counterparts
  4. Result in Table with exchange pairs
  5. Result in Fig with bar graph
